## üìñ Project Overview

The **Digital Pet Project** offers a unique take on the virtual pet experience. Each user account is home to a single pet, fostering a one-on-one bond. Pets evolve through three life stages‚Äî**Kid, Young, and Mature**‚Äîbased on your interactions. Feeding and playing with your pet awards Experience Points (XP), driving its growth. A special **Emotional Bond Meter** tracks your connection, and once a certain threshold is reached, you can chat with your pet, with its personality and responses powered by AI.

Pets have unique genetic traits that influence their appearance. When mature pets breed, an AI determines the offspring's characteristics based on its parents' genes. After a long and happy life (Level 60+), pets will face an unpredictable death, allowing the user to adopt a new companion and start a new journey. This prototype is built entirely on free-tier services to demonstrate the concept without incurring costs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **One Pet Per Account**: Fosters a strong, singular bond between the user and their digital companion.
- **Level-Based Evolution**: Pets progress through **Kid (Lv 1-15)**, **Young (Lv 16-30)**, and **Mature (Lv 31+)** stages by gaining XP from interactions.
- **Emotional Bond Meter**: Unlock an **AI-powered chat** with your pet by building a strong bond through care and play.
- **Genetic System**: Pets possess unique genes (color, ears, patterns) that define their appearance.
- **AI-Driven Breeding**: Mature pets (Lv 31+) can breed. **Gemini AI** determines the offspring's traits by combining parental genes.
- **Unpredictable Lifecycle**: Pets reaching Level 60+ face a random, unpredictable death, creating a realistic and meaningful lifecycle.
- **Social Interaction**: Visit other users' pets and engage in joint activities.
- **Customization**: Personalize your pet's environment with different backgrounds and equip them with fun accessories.

## ü§ñ How It Works

1.  **Adoption**: New users sign up via Google OAuth. You can take an optional personality quiz to get a pet recommendation (Cat, Dog, Bird, or Turtle) or choose one directly. A breed is then randomly assigned.
2.  **Care & Growth**: You raise your pet by **feeding** it and **playing** with toys. Each action grants XP and Bond Points.
    - **XP** levels up your pet, advancing it through life stages.
    - **Bond Points** increase your connection. At 50 points, the AI chat feature unlocks.
    - **Neglect** (24 hours of no interaction) will result in a small loss of XP and Bond Points.
3.  **Breeding**: Once your pet reaches the **Mature** stage (Level 31+), you can list it in a public breeding pool or select a partner from the pool. The AI then generates a unique offspring based on the parents' genetic traits.
4.  **End of Life**: After reaching Level 60, your pet has a small, random chance of passing away each day. You'll be notified when this happens, and its data will be archived, allowing you to adopt a new pet and begin again.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React (via CDN) & Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Node.js & Express
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth)
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI
-   **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)
-   **Design Tools**: Aseprite / Krita (for sprites)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed.
-   A Google Firebase project for authentication.
-   A MongoDB Atlas account for the database.
-   A Google AI Studio API key for Gemini.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/digital-pet-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/digital-pet-project.git)
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages** for the backend
    ```sh
    cd digital-pet-project/backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```
4.  **Start the backend server**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5.  **Open the frontend `index.html`** file in your browser to view the application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prototype Limitations

This project is a prototype and operates under the constraints of free-tier services:
-   **Backend Hosting**: The Render free tier may cause the server to spin down after a period of inactivity, leading to a slow initial load time.
-   **Database & Storage**: MongoDB (512 MB) and Vercel (100 MB) have limited storage.
-   **AI API Calls**: The use of Gemini AI is limited to 1,500 requests per day.
-   **Scalability**: The current setup is designed for a small user base (~10-20 concurrent users) for testing and demonstration.
-   **Simulated Payments**: Premium features are for demonstration only and do not involve real transactions.

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

-   **Monetization**: Implement a real payment system for premium items and cosmetics.
-   **Scalability**: Upgrade to paid service tiers to support a larger user base.
-   **Enhanced AI**: Utilize more advanced AI models for richer pet personalities, dynamic interactions, and more complex genetic inheritance.
-   **More Pet Types**: Introduce new species and breeds for users to adopt.
